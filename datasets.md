In [Changeat et al. 2022](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac5cc2) and  [Edwards et al. 2023](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac9f1a), we conducted the largest systematic surveys of exoplanet atmospheres with HST. In total, 25 exoplanets observed in eclipse and 70 exoplanets observed in transit were analyzed. The HST spectra are obtained with the [Iraclis](https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/Iraclis) dedicated spectral reduction and extraction tool, and then interpreted using atmospheric population retrievals by the Alfnoor code.
