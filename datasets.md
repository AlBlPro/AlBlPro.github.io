**Catalogue of HST exoplanet eclipses:** In [Changeat et al. 2022](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac5cc2), we conducted a systematic analysis of 25 exoplanets observed in eclipse by HST Grism G141. The HST spectra are obtained with the [Iraclis](https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/Iraclis) dedicated spectral reduction and extraction tool, and then interpreted using atmospheric population retrievals by the Alfnoor code.

**Catalogue of HST exoplanet transits:** In [Edwards et al. 2023](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac9f1a), we conducted a systematic analysis of 70 exoplanets observed in transit by HST Grism G141. The HST spectra are obtained with the [Iraclis](https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/Iraclis) dedicated spectral reduction and extraction tool, and then interpreted using atmospheric population retrievals by the Alfnoor code.
