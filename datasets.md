In [Changeat et al. 2022](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac5cc2) and  [Edwards et al. 2023](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac9f1a), we conducted the largest systematic surveys of exoplanet atmospheres with HST. In total, 25 exoplanets observed in eclipse and 70 exoplanets observed in transit were analyzed. The HST spectra are obtained with the [Iraclis](https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/Iraclis) dedicated spectral reduction and extraction tool, and then interpreted using atmospheric population retrievals by the Alfnoor code.       <br />

As part of the Ariel data challenge 2022 ([Yip et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14642)) supported by the NeurIPS Conference, we produced 105,877 realistic Ariel observations in Tier-2 resolutions complemented by atmospheric retrievals produced from TauREx3 using the Nested Sampling algorithms. The article describing the problem setup and the Ariel Big challenge (ABC) Database is [Changeat & Yip 2022](https://academic.oup.com/rasti/article/2/1/45/6998590).       <br />
