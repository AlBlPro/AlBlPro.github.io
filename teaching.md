**High School [ORBYTs](http://www.twinkle-spacemission.co.uk/orbyts/) program: An introduction to exoplanetary sciences**

As part of the independant low cost space telescope initiative Twinkle, I participate in the education program by providing introductory lectures on exoplanets to high scool students. Lectures cover the solar system, detection methods, telescopes, atmospheres and interiors.
