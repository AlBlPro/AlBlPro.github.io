[TauREx](https://github.com/ucl-exoplanets/TauREx3_public) (Tau Retrieval for Exoplanets) is a open source software, developed by Dr. Ahmed F. Al-Refaie and myself. The suite provides radiative transfer forward models, chemical codes, clouds models and other exo-atmospheric tools for the study of transit, eclipse and phase-curve data. Using optimization techniques, TauREx can retrieve the properties of exo-atmospheres from real observations. It is often employed by the community as a benchmark and it has been used in numerous workshops and summer schools. TauREx is one of the main codes used in the Ariel consortium to simulate the performances of the telescope. The new version TauREx 3.1 is available at: [TauREx3 documentation](https://taurex3-public.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), while the main publication can be consulted [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.07759).

## Missions

### ESA Ariel

[Ariel](https://ariel-spacemission.eu/) (Atmospheric Remote-sensing Exoplanet Large-survey) is one of the next medium-class missions selected by the European Space Agency. The telescope is due to launch in 2028 with the goal to observe thousands of exoplanets atmospheres to get insight on their composition and properties.
