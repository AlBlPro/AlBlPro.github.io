Here are some of the projects/tools I'm currently working on.

### JDart
[JDart](https://github.com/psycopaths/jdart)
 is a tool for *concolic execution* of Java Bytecode programs. It is built on NASA Java Pathfinder (JPF). Concolic execution executes the program with concrete and symbolic inputs at the same time. During execution, it maintains a path condition, a conjunction of symbolic expression over the inputs that encodes all the branches (i.e. condition with symbolic predicate) executed. Collectively, the path conditions characterize a constraints tree, and a new round of concolic execution is performed by solving the constraints of unexplored branches.

JDart is modularly built to facilitate experimentation with dynamic symbolic execution and it also achieves great performance as shown in {% cite tacas2016-ldghikrr %}.

### JConstraints
[JConstraints](https://github.com/psycopaths/jconstraints) is a solver abstraction layer for Java. It is a standalone library that is also used by JDart to interact transparently with SMT solvers. JConstraints has support for range of solvers through *plugins*, notably [JConstraints-Z3](https://github.com/psycopaths/jconstraints-z3), [JConstraints-SMTinterpol](https://github.com/psycopaths/jconstraints-smtinterpol), and [JConstraints-CORAL](https://github.com/psycopaths/jconstraints-coral). For more details, check out the [Psycopaths GitHub Org](https://github.com/psycopaths/) and our paper {% cite tacas2016-ldghikrr %}.

### Log2Model
[log2model](https://github.com/ksluckow/log2model) is a tool for building behavioral models of systems from logs, telemetry data, and simulation data obtained from, e.g., previous (or similar) tests/simulations. The models generated by Log2Model are Discrete Time Markov Chains (encoded as Reactive Modules in [PRISM](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org)) and contain key information that can be used for reasoning about quantitative and qualitative properties expressed in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). Log2Model also has a component for temporal event detection based on machine learning that can be used for systems understanding. 

We have used the tool for analyzing log data from flight critical systems, including AutoResolver, an air-traffic conflict resolution system from NASA Ames, and SafeTugs, an application of self-driving vehicle technology for towing aircraft also from NASA Ames. For more details check out our paper {% cite hldvt2016 %}.
