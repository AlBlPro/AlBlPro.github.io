**Hubble observations used to answer key exoplanet questions:** Archival observations of 25 hot Jupiters by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have been analysed by an international team of astronomers, enabling them to answer five open questions important to our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres. Amongst other findings, the team found that the presence of metal oxides and hydrides in the hottest exoplanet atmospheres was clearly correlated with the atmospheres' being thermally inverted.

**AI can reliably spot molecules on exoplanets – and might one day even discover new laws of physics:** AI experts found that a well-trained AI relies heavily on physical phenomena, such as unique spectroscopic fingerprints – just like an astronomer would. The team at UCL developed the first method to have a sneaky peek into so-called “AI black-boxes”, allowing them to evaluate what the AIs have learnt. With these tools, researchers now can not only use AIs to speed up their analysis of exo-atmospheres, but they can also verify that their AI uses well-understood laws of nature.

**How can some planets be hotter than stars? We’ve started to unravel the mystery:** The hottest exoplanet known so far is Kelt-9 b, which was discovered in 2016. In our study, we used publicly available data, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, to obtain the eclipse spectrum of this planet. We then used open-source software to extract the presence of molecules and found there were plenty of metals (made from molecules). This discovery is interesting as it was previously thought that these molecules would not be present at such extreme temperatures – they would be broken apart into smaller compounds. This implies some complex chemical and dynamical processes must take place in KELT-9 b atmospheres.
