I am Quentin, a researcher at the European Space Agency (ESA), where I study the properties of exoplanet atmospheres. As a member of the ESA office at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore US, my focus is on the analysis of observations with the new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). I use JWST spectroscopic observations to understand the nature and the origins of exoplanets by studying their atmospheres. I am also involved in data analyses for other space missions such as the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the Spitzer Space Telescope and the CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). 

To analyse exoplanet atmospheric data, I have developed a number of tools and new techniques. This allowed me to extract the chemistry and physical properties of about 70 transitting exoplanets with HST, ranging from the temperate super-Earth LHS-1140b to the extremely-hot Jupiter KELT-9b. Interested in the properties of exoplanet populations, I am also deeply involved in the development of the ESA-Ariel mission. Ariel, which will be launched in 2029, will observe about 1000 exoplanets to answer the major questions of the field.
