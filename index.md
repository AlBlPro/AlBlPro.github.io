I am Quentin, a researcher for the European Space Agency (ESA), where I study the properties of exoplanet atmospheres. As a member of the ESA office at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, my focus is on the analysis of observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). I use JWST spectroscopic observations to understand the nature and the origins of exoplanets by studying their atmospheres. I am also involved in the analysis of observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the Spitzer Space Telescope and the CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). 

For those analyses, I developed a number of new techniques to perform atmospheric retrievals. This allowed me to extract the chemistry and physical properties of about 70 transitting exoplanets, ranging from the temperate super-Earth LHS-1140b to the extremely-hot Jupiter KELT-9b. Interested in the properties of exoplanet populations, I am deeply involved in the development of the ESA-Ariel mission. Ariel, which will be launched in 2029, will observe about 1000 exoplanets to answer the major questions of the field.
