I am a French PhD researcher in Physics at the University College London, currently investingating exoplanets atmospheres. My PhD is funded by the UK Space Agency and the European Research Council in the contexte of the Ariel Mission from ESA. The mission aims to build a 1m space telescope dedicated to characterize the composition of these extrasolar worlds and is planned to be launched in 2028. 

### Research Interests
My current research interests include:

- Characterization of exoplanets and their atmospheres: composition, temperature profiles, dynamics.
- Retrieval and Machine learning methods.
- Space sciences: space missions, humans in space.
- Fundamental physics and Mathematics


During my Ph.D., I worked on temporal verification of real-time embedded systems using a combination of static analysis and Timed Automata model checking using the [UPPAAL](http://www.uppaal.org/) model checker. As part of this effort, I developed TetaSARTS, a tool for generating a Timed Automata description from Java real-time systems written in Safety Critical Java. Among others, I also developed a time predictable version of the [Hardware near Virtual Machine](http://www.icelab.dk/) (HVM), a lean and portable JVM implementation targeting embedded systems.

In 2013, I was a visiting researcher at [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html), Mountain View, where I worked with [Corina Păsăreanu](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/profile/pcorina/) on symbolic execution, temporal analysis of systems, and probabilistic software analysis.
